# McDonald-s-Menu-Nutritional-Analysis---Project

This project wants to look at what's inside the food at McDonald's to help people make better choices when they order. 
We'll check how much fat, sugar, and other stuff is in the food. This helps customers who want to eat healthier. It also helps McDonald's because they can see which foods are really popular and which ones maybe need to change. They can then make new foods that are better for everyone.
